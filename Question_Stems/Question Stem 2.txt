Instead of vertically integrating, consider an option where Terra tried to create a 'platform' that creates standards and rules for building components to interact with each other and primarily facilitates building component manufacturers, material suppliers, prefabbers, architects, designers, engineers, and general contractors to interact and contract with each other. Please assess the potential of such a platform model to create a sustainable strategic advantage (22 points in total).
